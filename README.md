# pong-exercise

This program was created as part of a Python course as an exercise 
in using class inheritance. This was my own implementation. While
I did get a few hints from the lesson, I did not look at any of
the instructor's code.

### Possible TODO

- As the movement of the ball increases with each bounce, 
the distance from the ball to the paddle should also increase 
when detecting a ball/paddle bounce. Otherwise, the longer a ball
remains in play the ball will start to clip through the paddle.
It may eventually pass right through.

I may never implement this. I think I've learned what I need to 
from this lesson and would rather move on.
